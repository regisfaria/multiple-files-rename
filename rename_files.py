in my directory i had the following setup
folder/
	samples001/
		img001-0001.png
		img001-0002.png
		img001-0003.png
		img001-0004.png
		.
		.
		.
	samples002/
		img002-0001.png
		img002-0002.png
		img002-0003.png
		.
		.
		.
	.
	.
	.

And my objective was to rename them to paste into another folder which had the same filenames
so i would only change the number string after the '-', and will not be conflicted anymore
