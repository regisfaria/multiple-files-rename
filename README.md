# Multiple files rename

## OVERVIEW

Quick python script I've made to rename a lot of files from a dataset I had that was conflicting with the destination I wished to paste into to.

This code will get all directories and files that this file is pasted on. After that it appends all in a list. Each position of that list have the directorie and its respectives files.

## REQUIREMENTS

I'm using python 3.7, but it will probably work for older versions(although i'm not sure of it)

Besides built-in libs, I use tqdm for progress bar

```
$ pip3 install tqdm
```
